# Introduction

My project aims to investigate the evolution of the NBA, and what it takes to be the best of the best.
The data was retreived from [Kaggle Set 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nickalden/nba-top-scorers-stats-and-shot-details-2000-2024?resource=download), [Kaggle Set 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robertsunderhaft/nba-player-season-statistics-with-mvp-win-share) , and [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/mvp.html).
I have always maintained an obsession with the NBA, and I wished to discover the correlation between various statistics, such as being the best scorer and winning the MVP.
I will investigate several statistics, such as field goal percentage, three pointers made, and the chance of a top ten scorer being the MVP.
(All graphs in this markdown are only using data from 2000-2022, and the data is only that of players that were in the top ten list for scoring for each season.)

# Data Preparation

First, I downloaded two data sets from Kaggle using a zip file.
The data sets contained data from different season ranges, 1982-2022 for one, and 2000-2024 for the other, so I simply removed all data outside of the range of 2000-2022.
I then renamed the columns storing the name of the players to be the same, as I could then merge the data sets using their name as the key.
There were no NAs in the data set to be removed.
An issue with the data is that one set had averages, while the other had averages and totals.
To resolve this, I removed all repetitive columns to clean the merged data set.
Then, I scraped MVP data from Basketball Reference using code, and created a new column in the data set to store the values of the MVP data.

mvp_chance = nrow(NBA_LEADERS[NBA_LEADERS$MVP == 'YES', ]) / nrow(NBA_LEADERS)
mvp_chance  # Return the MVP chance as a proportion
```

From 2000-2022, there were `r good_shooters_count` 50-40-90 seasons.
The average amount of points required to be a top ten scorer in the NBA is `r round(mean(NBA_LEADERS$PTS), 0)`.
The probability that a top ten scorer won MVP is `r round(mvp_chance,4) * 100`%.

# Univariate Analyses

The distribution of Field Goal Percentage (FG%) is shown in the above histogram.
The data suggest that most players have a FG% between 40% and 50%.
The mean FG% is `r round(mean(NBA_LEADERS$FG_PCT), 2)`, and the standard deviation is `r round(sd(NBA_LEADERS$FG_PCT), 2)`, which indicates the spread of the percentages around the mean.

The PTS distribution can be found in the histogram above.
The majority of players scored around between 1900 and 2100.
The average PPG is `r round(mean(NBA_LEADERS$PTS), 0)`, and the standard deviation is `r round(sd(NBA_LEADERS$PTS), 0)`, indicating the spread of points per game across the players.

The data reveals that the number of three-point shots made varies widely, with most players making between 30 and 200 three-pointers in a season.
The mean FG3M is `r round(mean(NBA_LEADERS$FG3M), 0)`, and the standard deviation is `r round(sd(NBA_LEADERS$FG3M), 0)`.
This is due to the style of basketball changing, which will be investigated later.

The graph of top ten players per team can be found above.
The max of the data is was 19, and the minimum was 1.
The data is not obviously skewed, and reflects the notion that larger-market teams have better players.

# Multivariate Analyses

The scatter plot of field goal percentage (FG%) and points per game (PPG) can be seen above.
As is evident by the plot and the moderate correlation (`r round(cor(NBA_LEADERS$FG_PCT, NBA_LEADERS$PPG), 2)`), there is only a slight correlation between higher points per game and higher efficiency.
This is likely due to the fact that better scorers receive tough defense, and shoot the ball much more, resulting in worse efficiency.

The box plot of player rank (1 to 10) and their MVP status demonstrates that MVP players tend to be ranked higher (closer to 1), indicating a strong relationship between high performance and MVP awards.
The correlation between Player Rank and MVP Count is `r round(cor(rankvsmvp$AVGRank, rankvsmvp$MVPCount), 2)`, showing a low negative correlation.
This is expected, as top-ranked players are more likely to win MVP.

The line plot displays the average three-point field goals made (FG3M) has evolved over time (seasons).
The increasing trend suggests a shift in playing style with an emphasis on three-point shooting in more recent years (due to Stephen Curry).
This strong correlation (`r correlation`), reflecting the NBA’s strategic evolution and the growing importance of the three-point shot in the modern game.

The box plot of PPG and the amount of MVPs a player has demonstrates that MVP players do not necessarily tend to have higher PPG, indicating a weak relationship between higher points per game and MVPs.This is further proven by the correlation between PPG and MVP Count (`r round (cor(mvp_counted$PPG, mvp_counted$MVPCount), 2)`).

# Reproducibility

I added comments throughout the code to clearly demonstrate what is happening in the program.
Further, I did not use any code to set the working directory, ensuring that the code may be run on any computer.

# Choice Elements

In this report, I included several choice elements.
I merged three datasets, two with NBA player statistics and another with MVP data, using the player name as a key.
I created two new variables: GOOD_SHOOTER, which categorizes players based on their high shooting statistics (FG%, 3P%, FT%), and MVP, which marks whether a player won the MVP award in a given season.
I formatted the season.y variable to ensure it was numeric for analysis.
I used a loop to check each player’s MVP status across seasons and an if statement to assign “YES” or “NO” to the MVP column based on matching data.
I used web scraping to find the MVP data, and used code to create the data set.
I used many if else statements, such as when I counted the amount of MVPs a player won, or when determined if a player had a 50-40-90 season (GOOD_SHOOTER).

# Conclusion

The results of this anaylsis were largely consistent with expectations, that MVP is a difficult award to win and cannot be correlated to only one statistic.
I also found that much of the NBA is experiencing change, whether it be in 3 pointers made, or in where the best players are playing.
I was surprised to find that many of the correlations I expected to be strong were rather weak.
PPG and MVP, for example, shocked me.
However, it is not all that surprising when thought about logically, for many players score many points on teams with no chance of winning, making them poor contenders for MVP.
Most others did meet my expecations, especially looking at 3PM over time for the players, as this fits the new age of basketball being played.
